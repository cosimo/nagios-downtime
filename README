DESCRIPTION
    Nagios is a widely used systems monitoring application.

    This script will schedule downtime for a given hostname for you in your
    Nagios server from the command line, saving you the "painful" experience
    of opening your browser and going through the Nagios web interface.

    It's meant to be used as quick utility to schedule downtime unattended,
    when launching scripts that are not run at some regular point in time
    every day/week, but something you have to run at random times.

    At present, there's no way to cancel a scheduled downtime.

OPTIONS
    "-help" Print a brief help message and exits.

    "-server"
            The nagios server hostname (ex.: "nagios.yourdomain.lan")

    "-protocol"
            If you're using https, you may specify "-protocol=https" or
            "-port=443".

    "-port" If you're running nagios on a port different from 443 (https) or
            80 (http) then you need to specify the port number here (ex.:
            "-port=2222").

    "-user" Nagios username that you can use in the web interface

    "-pass" Nagios password that you can use in the web interface

    "-hostname"
            The host for which you want to schedule downtime (ex.:
            "blah.domain.com")

    "-message"
            Comment for the downtime (ex.: "Reinstallation in progress").
            Max 40 chars.

    "-start"
            Timestamp for when the downtime should start. This is in seconds
            since epoch, yes, Unix timestamp.

            Defaults to now.

    "-duration"
            Duration of downtime. By default, 2 hours if not specified.
